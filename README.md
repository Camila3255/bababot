### Definite Nos

- Designated commands for snuggling/hugging/kissing/petting/whatever with other users.
  - There are already guidelines against excessive gifs in chat and this would make the (admittedly non-existent) problem worse.
- AI related commands
  - AI is sorely cringe and stupid. My apologies.
- Slash Commands
  - Uses web packets instead of being sent the pure `json` of the message, limiting the speed of the bot somewhat
- Random Text/Property/Level/Asset generator
  - Use [Robot is Chill](https://github.com/balt-dev/robot-is-chill) for that purpose.
- Other 'Generator' commands
  - I don't want bot channel(s) being filled with users running the same command over and over.
